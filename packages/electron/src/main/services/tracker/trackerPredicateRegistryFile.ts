/**
 * The LOCAL COPY of a workspace's predicate registry: `.nimbalyst/predicates.yaml`.
 *
 * Per decision 12 of the knowledge-scopes plan, and per
 * `docs/TRACKER_SCHEMA_SHARING.md`, this file is a copy and never the
 * distribution mechanism for a team project. The room owns the registry and
 * publishes it to every client on the schema lane, exactly as it does type
 * definitions; this module projects what arrived onto disk so the project is
 * readable offline and authorable by a project that has no
 * room yet.
 *
 * A sibling of `trackerSchemaProjection.ts` rather than more of
 * `TrackerSchemaService.ts`, which is already 1,300 lines.
