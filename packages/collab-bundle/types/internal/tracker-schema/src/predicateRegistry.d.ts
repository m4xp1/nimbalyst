/**
 * Predicate registry (knowledge-scopes contract 4.1).
 *
 * A predicate is the verb in a statement: `product --integrates-with--> product`,
 * qualified by "via which connector", "which operations", "tested against which
 * client version". The registry is the declaration of those verbs, and it is a
 * SCHEMA ARTIFACT, not project configuration. Per decision 12 the room owns it
 * and publishes it to every client exactly like a type definition;
 * `.nimbalyst/predicates.yaml` is a local copy, never the distribution
 * mechanism. The transport lives in `schemaSyncPayload.ts` and rides the lane
 * type definitions already ride.
 *
 * This module is pure: plain objects in, issues out. It is reachable from
 * desktop, the web console, the collab server (which depends on this package
 * for C3/C4/C5), and both MCP surfaces, which is the whole point -- section 7
 * requires that "a predicate with required qualifiers rejects a claim missing
 * them" report the SAME code on all four.
 *
 * Three properties shape this file, and they are the same three that shape
 * `./citationLocator.ts` for the same reasons.
 *
 * **Stable codes.** Every failure carries a `PREDICATE_*` code and a property
 * path. A message is for a person; a code is what a caller may branch on.
 *
 * **Strict on values, tolerant on declarations.** An unknown qualifier VALUE on
 * a statement and an unknown qualifier type are rejections: `operation` for
 * `operations` would otherwise be dropped, the required qualifier would read as
 * missing, and the author would be told to supply a qualifier they believe they
 * just supplied. An unknown KEY on a predicate or qualifier declaration is a
 * warning instead: a later release adds keys (`range`, `options`) to this
 * file, and a client that rejected them would drop the whole registry and
 * every statement's contract with it. The key is kept, not stripped.
 *
 * **Every issue in one pass.** A form or an MCP caller fixes a value in one
 * round trip rather than one per property.
 *
 * What this module does NOT do: resolve a relationship target, read items, or
 * decide whether a registry change is safe. That last one is
 * `./trackerPredicateRegistryChangeClassifier.ts`, which applies the same
 * additive-versus-destructive rule type schemas already get.
