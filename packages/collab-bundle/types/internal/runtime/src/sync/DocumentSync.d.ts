/**
 * DocumentSyncProvider
 *
 * Client-side Yjs document sync over WebSocket. Connects to a DocumentRoom
 * Durable Object, sends/receives Yjs updates, and manages awareness state.
 *
 * Custody is server-managed: team documents are PLAINTEXT over TLS, the
 * server holds the team DEK and encrypts at rest, and the client holds no
 * team key. `encodeForWire` is a base64 pass-through. The wire field is
 * still named `encrypted` and the local replica on disk IS genuinely
 * encrypted -- wire and at-rest are different axes. Before changing
 * anything named `encrypt*` here, read the lane table in
 * docs/IDENTITY_AUTH_AND_ROOMS.md section 6.
 *
 * The provider:
 * - Attaches to a LocalDocumentReplica/Y.Doc (or creates one for back-compat)
 * - Encodes outgoing Yjs updates for the wire and applies inbound ones
 * - Handles sync (initial load), realtime broadcasts, and awareness
 *
 * Remote updates merge and land like any other CRDT update -- a shared room is
 * shared, so there is no per-collaborator accept/reject step. Recovering an
 * earlier state is an explicit user action (resync / restore), not a gate on
 * every inbound edit.
