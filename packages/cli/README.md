# nim — Nimbalyst companion CLI

`nim` drives Nimbalyst's tracker system from the terminal — list, get, and show
tracker items (bugs, tasks, decisions, imported records) without opening the
desktop app. It mirrors the semantics of Nimbalyst's tracker MCP tools so a
terminal agent works the way an agent inside Nimbalyst does.

> Status: **Phases 1–3 complete**. Tracker reads; create/update/comment/archive/
> link-session and `types define|rm` (live mode → WriteCoordinator + collab sync,
> plus **guarded offline direct writes** when the app is closed); and importers
> (`importers`, `import search`, `import <id>`, `import resnapshot`) in live mode.
> Only Phase 4 polish (`--jq`/`--template`, config file, shell completions, npm
> prebuilt-binary publishing) remains.

## Two access modes behind one interface

- **Live mode** — talks to a *running* Nimbalyst over its loopback MCP-HTTP
  server (reads reflect in-app state). Discovered via the endpoint descriptor the
  app writes at startup (`<userData>/mcp-endpoint.json`, mode 0600).
- **Direct mode** — opens the better-sqlite3 file directly when the app is not
  running. Reads use a **read-only** handle (safe even while the app is live,
  thanks to WAL). **Writes** open a writable WAL handle and run inside
  `BEGIN IMMEDIATE … COMMIT`, but only when no live app owns the DB — if the
  endpoint descriptor shows a running app on the default DB, every write is
  refused (exit 5) so the CLI never races the app's writer. Offline mutations of
  sync-eligible items set `sync_status='pending'`; the app drains them on next
  launch through its normal sync backfill.

The CLI auto-detects: it tries live discovery first and falls back to direct.
`--live` / `--offline` force a mode; `--db <file>` points at a specific database.

## Usage

```
nim <noun> <verb> [--flags]

nim status
nim workspace list
nim tracker ready --type bug
nim tracker list --type bug --status open --priority high --since 1d --limit 20
nim tracker list --where severity=critical --where tags~auth --json
nim tracker get  NIM-123
nim tracker get  github://owner/repo#42
nim tracker show NIM-123          # pretty body render
nim tracker types [show <type>]
nim session list                  # read-only (v1)
nim doc list / nim doc get <path> # read-only (v1)

# Writes (live mode — a running Nimbalyst)
nim tracker create bug "Login times out" --status to-do --priority high \
    --tag auth --field severity=critical --body-file repro.md
nim tracker update NIM-123 --status in-review --unset owner
nim tracker comment NIM-123 "Repro confirmed"
nim tracker archive NIM-123 / nim tracker unarchive NIM-123
nim tracker link-session NIM-123 [--session <id>]   # live only
nim tracker types define -f bug.yaml / nim tracker types rm bug

# Importers (live mode only — backends are hosted by the running app)
nim tracker importers
nim tracker import search github-issues --repo owner/repo --state open --search login --limit 20
nim tracker import github-issues "owner/repo#42" --type bug
nim tracker import resnapshot github://owner/repo#42
```

> In **live mode** writes route through the app's existing tracker MCP tools, so a
> CLI-written change is identical to an in-app one (validation, activity, sync).
> `--field` only persists schema-declared fields (the app validates against the
> type), and comments on synced trackers follow the app's normal sync
> reconciliation. In **offline (direct) mode** writes are shaped to match those
> handlers and cover native items only (file-backed inline/frontmatter items
> refuse, exit 5). Custom types that remap roles (e.g. `roles.title='name'`) are
> resolved offline by reading the app-materialized `tracker_type_defs` table;
> types the app hasn't materialized fall back to default field names.
> `link-session` and `types define|rm` are live-only.

### Filters

- `--type`, `--type-tag`, `--priority`, `--owner me|<o>`, `--search`
- `--status open|closed|<status>` — `open`/`closed` resolve against the set of
  terminal statuses (done/closed/completed/resolved/rejected/…).
- `--since` / `--until` — relative (`1d`, `2w`, `3h`) or absolute (`2026-06-01`);
  `--date-field created` switches off the default `updated`.
- `--where field<op>value` (repeatable) — ops `=`, `!=`, `~` (contains),
  `=in:a,b,c`.
- `nim tracker ready` is the preset for `nim tracker list --where readiness=ready`.
- `--limit <n>` / `--all`, `--archived`.

### Output

- TTY default: a compact, colored table.
- `--json` — the canonical `TrackerRecord` (the stable agent contract).
- `--csv` + `--columns a,b,c` — tabular export.
- `--quiet`/`-q` — ids only. `--no-color` (also honors `NO_COLOR` / non-TTY).

### Exit codes

`0` ok · `1` not found · `2` usage · `3` connection (incl. importers in offline
mode) · `4` schema-incompatible · `5` write-not-permitted (a live app owns the
DB, or a live-only command in offline mode) · `6` partial write (`nim wiki`
only: the item was written but its page text failed; do not retry the same
call, it would hit the same failure).

### Env

`NIM_DB`, `NIM_WORKSPACE`, `NIM_ENDPOINT` + `NIM_TOKEN` (force live), `NIM_OWNER`
(resolves `--owner me`), `NO_COLOR`, `NIM_DEBUG` (stack traces).

## Hosted wiki

The `wiki` commands talk to the hosted wiki on the collab server with your Nimbalyst Teams sign-in, not to a running Nimbalyst app. They mirror the `wiki_*` MCP tools the `nimbalyst-wiki` Claude Code plugin uses. A repository reaches a wiki through the team project a team admin connected its remote to; who belongs is decided in Nimbalyst Teams.

```sh
nim login                      # device code, approved in the Nimbalyst console
nim whoami / nim logout
nim wiki status                # unbound (with your teams) | bound | ambiguous
nim wiki bind --org <id> --project <id>                  # team admins
nim wiki create-project --org <id> --name <n> [--bind]   # team admins
nim wiki pin --org <id> --project <id>                   # one of the projects this repo resolves to
nim wiki list --type claim --json
nim wiki changes show <changesetId>
```

`repo` is `git remote get-url origin`. `.nimbalyst/wiki.json` holds an optional `{ orgId, projectId }` pin, sent as `project` to choose among projects you can already reach; it grants nothing. `--repo`, or `--org` with `--project`, targets something else and ignores the current directory's wiki.json. `nim wiki pin` only accepts a project the repository actually resolves to (one of an ambiguous match, or its bound project), and only for the current checkout. Changesets are an activity log of what each session wrote, not an undo step: correct a page by editing it. Changeset commands confirm the resolved project with the server first. Writes need `--changeset <id>` from `nim wiki changes begin`. Tokens live in `credentials.json` (mode 0600, directory 0700) under the user config dir, are written under a lock, and refresh on their own; `nim logout` revokes the session on the server before deleting them.

Env: `NIM_SERVER` (default `https://sync.nimbalyst.com`; `http://` only for localhost), `NIM_CONSOLE` (web console origin for printed links, default `https://console.nimbalyst.com`), `NIM_CONFIG_DIR` (credentials location), `NIM_GITHUB_NATIVE=on` (the earlier GitHub sign-in and per-wiki membership commands, off by default; `NIM_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` configures its device flow).

## Notes for maintainers

- Pure tracker record, key, release, status, and readiness semantics come from `@nimbalyst/tracker-core`, the same built package consumed by the runtime. Direct mode injects materialized type models alongside the full item corpus.
- `src/gateway/trackerWrite.ts` owns only host-specific offline write helpers (activity mutation, the stored comment shape, git-config identity, and local ID generation). `DirectGateway` deliberately mirrors the app handlers rather than using `recordToDbParams`, and the cross-host regression test requires their stored activity bytes to remain identical.
- `better-sqlite3` is a native dependency and must match the version the app ships. Version 13 uses Node-API prebuilds shared by supported Node and Electron hosts; the CLI's Node 22 floor matches its upstream engine requirement.
- `MAX_KNOWN_SCHEMA` in `src/gateway/schema.ts` pins the newest tracker schema
  this build was verified against; bump it as the app's schema advances.

## Develop

```
npm run build       # tsc -> dist/
npm run typecheck
npm test            # vitest (DirectGateway fixture tests)
```
